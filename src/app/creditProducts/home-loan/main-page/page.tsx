            A home loan is a financial product offered by lenders to individuals
            for purchasing residential property. It covers a significant portion
            of the property's cost, while the borrower is required to make a
            down payment. The remaining amount is repaid through Equated Monthly
            Instalments (EMIs). The loan tenure typically ranges from 5 to 30
            years.

                    and interest components. Home loans come with different

                    Apart from the principal and interest, home loans may have
                    additional charges such as:
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
                      <li>
                        <strong>Processing fee:</strong> 0.5% to 2% of the loan
                        amount
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Legal and valuation charges:</strong> Based on
                        the lender's policies
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Late payment fees:</strong> If EMIs are not paid
                        on time
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Prepayment or foreclosure charges:</strong> If
                        the loan is repaid before the tenure
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    It's important to factor in these costs when planning your
                    loan.
